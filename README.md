CSSI 2020 Template
=================

1. Get your own copy of this repo by clicking the "use template" button. 
2. Clone it to the development environment of your choice using the `git clone` command.
3. Write your p5.js project code in the `script.js` file, or if you choose to write it elsewhere, be sure to link the correct script in the `index.html` file.
4. Remember that if you want to use the "collide" library, you'll need to go to the `index.html` and uncomment the script element that connects that library. 
5. If you want to use any other p5.js libraries, be sure to either link the hosted versions of those libraries, or download those libraries and connect them as local files.
